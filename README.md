# Portfolio
This is a React project to display my value proposition, my portfolio of projects, and my thoughts regarding an incredible new world that is here already but will continue changing for the benefit of humanity, if we work towards it.

# Purpose
I could have use one off-the-shelf website from commercial suppliers but I decided to walk the talk and build it myself.
